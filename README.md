# Pricify

## Introduction

This repository contains a system for `storing prices of consumer goods and services` on a `Ethereum` blockchain.
The Pricify system provides a solution to a `problem of fake sales and prices` that consumers are facing while making purchasing decisions.

This system aims to fix the problem of intransparent sales and prices, bring the transparency, and help the consumers make `better economic decisions` while shopping.

`Price history of items/services is stored and recorded on Ethereum blockchain via smart contracts` ([more about smart contracts](#smart-contracts)). By storing the price updates and changes
on a public blockchain, anyone can verify the validity of the current discount. That will disable the merchants from manipulating the prices.

This implementation was done as part of master thesis for the [Master's degree in Software Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en/studies/master-studies/electrical-and-computer-engineering-2019/software-engineering#gsc.tab=0).

## Demo

Consumers have a possibility to determine the real price of the item and to verify the validity of the advertised sales:
- In `physical stores` - by scanning the QR code on the item, which will redirect them to the web page for sales validation and price history
- In `online stores` - by clicking the link for validating the price of the item; redirects to the same web page for sales validation and price history
